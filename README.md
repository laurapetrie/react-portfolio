<p>Hi, I'm Laura üëã

This is my frontend developer portfolio, built using React, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML. It tells you a little about my background, links to my projects and ways to contact me.

My first iteration of a portfolio website was a simple responsive site, however I decided to rebuild it using React. Having used React to create a weather app and dictionary app I was eager to start from scratch and build my portfolio website again, and along the way learn a little more about the features React has to offer. I've also included icons from Font Awesome and the motion component from Framer Motion to add some dynamism to the home page.

Project links include:
- a responsive website all about flowers
- a weather app built using Vanilla JS
- the same weather app rebuilt with React
- a dictionary app built with React

All with links to my GitHub, which are public and open source.

Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy my website! üë©‚Äçüíª</p>
